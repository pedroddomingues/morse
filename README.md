# Morse

This project is being made to practice my skills with Next.js. At the front page you can encode or decode a morse text.

You can also login with github (42 and email will soon be available).

In the future will be possible to share a message with someone.

## Techs
- Next.js
- Postgresql
- Vercel
- next-auth
